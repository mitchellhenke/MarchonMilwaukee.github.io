  As we’ve shared history of Milwaukee’s Open Housing Marches in communities around our city, we’ve found that this story of national importance is too often absent from our local memory. So, in addition to attending events throughout 200 Nights of Freedom, educating yourself about this history is a key way to honor the 50th anniversary.

<p>
50 years after the original marches and victory for fair housing, Milwaukee still has no public monument or memorial to the youth and adult activists who worked tirelessly to promote social justice, racial justice, and fair housing. What could a public monument to the movement look like? How can we commemorate the original marches and also acknowledge current activism in our cities?
</p>
<p>
We invite young people throughout the state of Wisconsin to submit entries of a public monument to the “Design a Monument Contest and Exhibition.” The contest is open for all youth from Grades 3-12. The theme of the contest is “Recognizing and Reigniting the March on Milwaukee.” Keywords that can inspire student designs include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social justice</li>
  <li>Fair housing</li>
  <li>Equal employment</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Equity</li>
  <li>Youth empowerment</li>
  <li>Civil rights</li>
  <li>Peace</li>
</ul>

  Milwaukee-born historian Erica Metcalfe has written two crucial articles detailing the contributions of the NAACP Youth Council and Commandos to Milwaukee’s Open Housing marches.
</p>
<p>
  Both published in Wisconsin Magazine of History, Metcalfe presents deeply important Milwaukee stories that are too often forgotten. It is the sincere opinion of the March On Milwaukee 50th committee that these two short articles are essential reading for all Milwaukeeans.
