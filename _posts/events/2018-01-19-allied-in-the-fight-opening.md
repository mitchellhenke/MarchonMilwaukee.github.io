Allied in the Fight explores the partnership between Jewish and African American leaders in confronting systematic racism in the United States. The exhibit addresses Black-Jewish collaboration within the Civil Rights Movement and the complicated nature of Jewish contributions to the Civil Rights movement through artifacts, archival materials and information from a national perspective.

Allied in the Fight is a part of the Milwaukee-wide initiative, “200 Nights of Freedom,” commemorating the 50th anniversary of the city’s 1967-68 Open Housing Marches. These marches took place over 200 consecutive days in support of the passing of a fair housing bill and were sponsored and organized by the Milwaukee NAACP Youth Council, its Commando unit, and Alderwoman Vel Phillips along with other supporters.

Join Jewish Museum Milwaukee to celebrate the allies of then and now with:
Clips from the documentary Vel Philips: Dream Big Dreams;
Prentice McKinney, former NAACP Youth Council Commando and a leader of Open Housing Demonstrations;
Arnold Kaufman, UW-Milwaukee Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Jewish community Civil Rights activist;
and Elana Kahn, Director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation.

Move to a “Civil Rights era” soundtrack including light jazz instrumentals and classic soul tunes from TRUE Skool, guided tours of Allied in the Fight, and soul food favorites with a kosher twist.
