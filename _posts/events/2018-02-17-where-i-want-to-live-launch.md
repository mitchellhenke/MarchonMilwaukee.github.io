Where I Want to Live: Poems for Fair and Affordable Housing is a poetry chapbook anthology project to honor all who participated in Milwaukee's 1967-68 open housing marches and to envision and help build the inclusive community we need. Inclusive of a range of poets and poetic styles, the chapbook serves as a metaphor for the inclusive neighborhoods we value and seek to build. 

This event is the launch of the chapbook and will feature readings from some of the book's contributors.

Chapbooks will continue to be available at Woodland Pattern and from the editorial team after the launch. Price: $10.00
