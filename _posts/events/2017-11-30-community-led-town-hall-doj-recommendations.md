Please join community leaders committed to seeing the process through to moving the Department of Justice's DOJ draft recommendations and our personal edits to even those moved through and implemented. 

Please spread the word and invite folks to the two town halls on the north side, Thursday, November 30th 6 p.m. and Saturday, December 3rd at 2 p.m. at Dr. Martin Luther King Elementary School, 3275 N. 3rd Street. 

We also invite youth agencies to bring their youth groups/organizations to these townhalls as well. 

We plan to hosts town halls on the city's south side after the holidays and we will announce those dates soon.
