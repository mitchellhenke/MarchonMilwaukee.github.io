Join Dominic Inouye, educator, artist and founder of ZipMKE, on a bus tour exploring Milwaukee’s historic Civil Rights sites, including the James E. Groppi Unity Bridge, the Bronzeville Loop, neighborhoods shared by African American and Jewish communities, and public works of art, including statues of Golda Meir, Martin Luther King, Vel Phillips, and Mahatma Gandhi.

Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Milwaukee’s Open Housing Marches, the tour explores these important places and the people who worked tirelessly for social justice and demonstrate the power of art to effect change, promote equal rights, and inspire community building."	Jewish Museum Milwaukee is dedicated to preserving and presenting the history of the Jewish people in southeastern Wisconsin and celebrating the continuum of Jewish heritage and culture. The history of American Jews is rooted in thousands of years of searching for freedom and equality. We are committed to sharing this story and the life lessons it brings with it, so that we may enhance the public’s awareness and appreciation of Jewish life and culture.
