“Tell your Race and Equity Stories” Workshop
Wednesday April 25th, 2018
6pm registration/light snacks; 6:30pm – 8:30pm workshop

[This is a free event however pre-registration is required. ](https://www.exfabula.org/product/fellows-storytelling-workshop/)

The Ex Fabula Fellows are a diverse cohort of Milwaukee adults who have worked together to craft true, personal stories about race and equity.

In this session, you’ll first be inspired by a few stories from the Fellows. Then, a storytelling coach will lead you through small group activities to help you start crafting your own stories about race and equity topics.
