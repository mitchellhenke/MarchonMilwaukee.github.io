We welcome you to attend, invite, and support our next Mass Meeting of 2018. Let's build, engage, educate, and work together with a focus on Community and Black Liberation.

Mission: 
Uplifting Black Liberation and Black Communities will EQUIP, CONNECT, and EDUCATE Black communities with resources and opportunities that will help provide sustainable environment free from oppressive systems. This begins by using education about potential impact on the community, and how to heal from post-traumatic slave syndrome. 

Vision: 
Through OUTREACH and COLLABORATION, UBLAC will help individuals foster understanding about liberation through knowledge and application in order to generate independent living and thinking
