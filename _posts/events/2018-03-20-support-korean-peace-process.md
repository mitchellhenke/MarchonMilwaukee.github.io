Please come to a press conference and gathering to support peace in the Korean peninsula, including dialog without pre-conditions between the U.S. and North Korea as well as South Korea.  We oppose all threats of military action and nuclear weapons in the area.

Join us also to experience a taste of Korean culture through snacks and tea and traditional music. Learn how Korean people and press have been responding to the recent developments. Hear Korean and U.S. born supporters of peace including Rev. PyungAhn “Pastor Peace” Kim, Associate Pastor at Whitefish Bay UMC; Jim Carpenter of Peace Action Wisconsin’s End the Wars committee; and others.
