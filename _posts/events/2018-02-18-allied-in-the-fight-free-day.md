Community Free Days are designed for Milwaukee County residents to explore the Jewish Museum Milwaukee for FREE! Learn about the Jewish community of Milwaukee through stories of immigration, Holocaust survivors, Golda Meir in our permanent exhibit. Then experience Allied in the Fight: Jews, Blacks and the Struggle for Civil Rights.

Community Free Days are sponsored by Brewers Community Foundation."	Jewish Museum Milwaukee is dedicated to preserving and presenting the history of the Jewish people in southeastern Wisconsin and celebrating the continuum of Jewish heritage and culture. The history of American Jews is rooted in thousands of years of searching for freedom and equality. We are committed to sharing this story and the life lessons it brings with it, so that we may enhance the publicâ€™s awareness and appreciation of Jewish life and culture.
