Highland Community School’s Winter Celebration is an annual concert where our students perform songs for our community. This year our students will be celebrating the beauty of various cultures and modern-day heroes in the face of new challenges. Students will reflect upon the truth that an injury to one is an injury to all, and injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.  

The themes of the selected songs include “Hate Has No Home” within our walls, a commitment to providing safety and rooting out oppression in our community, and that America and immigrants are forever intertwined.  

We will be celebrating activists from many different generations through song. Our students while learning the songs are also doing research about the different themes are inspired to continue the work. Highland Community School would not exist without the March on Milwaukee. Highland was born out of a passion for education equality, social justice, caring for each other, and a yearning for family involvement.

The show is free and always a good time. All are welcome.
