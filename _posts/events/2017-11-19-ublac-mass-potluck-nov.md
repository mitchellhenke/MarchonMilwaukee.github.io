[UBLAC](https://www.facebook.com/UBLACMKE/) welcome you to attend, invite, and support our next Potluck and Mass Meeting. This will be a space to continue to develop and foster relationships, connections, ideas, movement and resources. 

We will send out a list of items needed for the potluck. Excited and ready to continuing building with each of you!

Our mission:

Uplifting Black Liberation and Black Community will equip, connect, and educate Black communities with resources and opportunities that will help provide a sustainable environment free from oppressive systems. This begins by using education about potential impact on the community, and how to heal from post-traumatic slave syndrome.

Vision:

Through outreach and collaboration, UBLAC will help individuals foster understanding about liberation through knowledge and application in order to generate independent living and thinking.

Core Values:

Black Community, Sustainability, Inclusion, Justice, Dedication, Accountability, Integrity, Collaboration, Self Empowerment, Love Education, Trust.
