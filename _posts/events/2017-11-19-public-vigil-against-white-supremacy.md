In recent weeks the president acted to end DACA; Milwaukee Police gravely injured a young African-American and killed a legally blind African American would-be peacekeeper; hateful words and actions continued against our Muslim and Jewish neighbors; and our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico have been effectively abandoned following the devastation of Hurricane Maria. 

Please stand with us against white supremacy in all its hateful forms.

Our vigil will a silent one. Our bodies, our voices and our signs will speak our outrage and our sadness. And our resolve.

This Vigil is being co-sponsored by First Unitarian's Black Lives Matter Team and Immigration Issues Action Group. All are welcome.
