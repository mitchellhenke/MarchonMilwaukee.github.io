On October 6, 2015 the Milwaukee Independent made the 84 block, 5.5 mile hike across North Avenue to photo-document the corridor’s condition. On the second anniversary of that journey, we are retracing those steps to map and record the momentum of progress and development along the vital social and economic route.

The public is invited to come along, with the understanding that this is not a walking tour. Our purpose is to photograph what can be seen from either the North or South sidewalk of North Avenue while walking, without exploration of any sites along the way. The walk is expected to take 4 hours, and will begin promptly at 7:00 a.m. at the corner of North Avenue and Lake Park Drive. It will travel West by foot to 60th Street. Upon reaching that location the photo walk will conclude. Participants are encouraged to bring a MCTS M•Card (Route 21) for a return trip to the Lake Park Drive starting point.
