"Farmers Markets as Food Justice" is a discussion that will be FREE and open to the public. Join the Fondy Food Center with our partners at the Medical College of Wisconsin for a conversation around how farmers markets can be spaces for food and economic justice in our communities.

We are pleased to announce that Milwaukeeâ€™s Commissioner of Health, Bevan K. Baker, as well as Alice's Garden & The Table Director, Venice Williams, will be featured speakers at the event. 

Additional details to soon follow. Save the date and share with those who may be interested!
