Reggie Jackson of Americaâ€™s Black Holocaust Museum will take a look back at the history of structural and institutional racism in America and its direct impact on the lives of Native Americans and African Americans.

From the destruction of indigenous communities and cultures through current manifestations of racism, such as forced segregation and the legacies of Jim Crow, he will explore these ugly parts of American history that are so diffi cult to live with and talk about openly. He will then examine steps we can take to alleviate the burdens of this history.
