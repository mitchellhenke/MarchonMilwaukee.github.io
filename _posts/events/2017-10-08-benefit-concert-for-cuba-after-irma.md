Cuba was hit by Irma as a Category 5 Hurricane for 72 hours; it "absorbed much of the impact of Hurricane Irma which lessened the damage to southern Florida and the United States," according to a letter signed by Rep. Gwen Moore. It is the only area affected by recent hurricanes which is under U.S. economic sanctions, and the only nation in the area which send over 700 doctors  and medical personnel to assist other Caribbean islands devastated by the hurricanes. We'll hear live music from Tony Baez and others as well as a special music performance from Havana!
