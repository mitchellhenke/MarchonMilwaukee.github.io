YWCA, in conjunction with the Greater Milwaukee Foundation, will be hosting a conversation on the real issues affecting our communities and how we can collectively help to change.  Our conversation will be focused on the impact of race/racism and its role on Milwaukee's economically disadvantaged communities.
