UBLAC is hosting a community canvassing 2-day event to engage with the residents of Riverwest and Sherman Park. We want to find out what is important to residents and what their biggest concerns are within their neighborhood and within Milwaukee as a whole. 
We also want to be able to connect residents with resources and other events in Milwaukee so that everyone has access to and is aware of the various services and opportunities available to them.

We are inviting any community members who would like to get involved and help with this canvassing event to join us! TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED! We will provide all the tools and training necessary to successfully canvass these neighborhoods that follows the mission and vision of UBLAC. 

NOTE:
This is just one of 2 available time slots:

November 11th in Riverwest
9:30am-12:00pm (with training from 9:30am-10:00am)
12:30pm-3:00pm (with training from 12:30pm-1:00pm)

So please RSVP to any or all of the canvass events you will be available to attend.
