Fifty years after a diverse coalition led by African-American youth marched for fair housing in Milwaukee, the city remains racially divided and large segments of the black community live in poverty. What will it take to effect change? Markasa Tucker, lead organizer for UBLAC (Uplifting Black Liberation and Community), We Got This Founder Andre Lee Ellis and Vaun Mayes, co-founder of Program the Parks, will discuss challenges and successes in a conversation moderated by Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service reporter Jabril Faraj.

The panel discussion is taking place on Wednesday, Oct. 25. Space is limited for this free event, which will take place at the Outpost community room in the Innovations & Wellness Commons, 1617 W. North Ave.

Doors will open at 5:30 and the discussion will begin promptly at 6 p.m. Refreshments will be provided.
