First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee's Black Lives Matter team is hosting a conversation with community activists Vaun Mayes and Gabri-El Taylor Bey of Program the Parks/ITAV Community Empowerment & Solutions Center. Come learn about their efforts to bring resources and opportunities to Milwaukee's inner city youth, the buzz around their multifaceted get-it-done approach, and the ways that we can partner with them.

Directly following our public vigil. All are welcome. Light refreshments will be served.
 
Donâ€™t miss this important conversation.
