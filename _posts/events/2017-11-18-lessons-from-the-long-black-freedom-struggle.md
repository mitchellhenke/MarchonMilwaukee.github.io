This half-day workshop invites families to experience inspiring moments throughout the struggle for Black equality. The event begins with an opening keynote by Milwaukee native, Dr. Erica Metcalfe, author of two key pieces chronicling Milwaukee’s civil rights history: “Commanding a Movement: The Youth Council Commandos’ Quest for Quality Housing” and “Future Political Actors: The Milwaukee NAACP Youth Council’s Early Fight For Identity.” The morning session will highlight key moments in Milwaukee history. The afternoon session will expand the discussion into national and international developments.
