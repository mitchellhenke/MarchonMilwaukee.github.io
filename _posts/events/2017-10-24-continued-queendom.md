We are looking forward to CONTINUING the BUILD and MOEMENTUM with Black Queens after the march!

Please join us in the Yatchak Hall to debrief our work, continue conversations, but creating solid next steps to move us and our work forward. 

Be thinking about what do we need as Black Queens to do the work we are identifying. We can't work on others if we haven't taken time to first identify what we need to be well enough to carry the load and burden of building people for what we want, Black Empowerment, Unity all based in love for our people and our city. 

See you after the march!
