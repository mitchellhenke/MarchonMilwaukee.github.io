In Milwaukee county, the male population experiences heightened health risks relative to the rest of the population. These disproportionately high health issues include alcohol and drug use, which affects 58 percent of the total population; violence, which affects 55 percent of the population; and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease, as according to the Center for Urban Population Health's 2012-2013 Milwaukee County Community Health Needs Assessment. 

The panel will include experts from the fields of public health, medicine, and social justice who will discuss the health disparities across not only gender but race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and ability.
