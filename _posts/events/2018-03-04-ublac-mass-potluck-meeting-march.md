Our mission:
Uplifting Black Liberation and Black Community will equip, connect, and educate Black communities with resources and opportunities that will help provide a sustainable environment free from oppressive systems. This begins by using education about potential impact on the community, and how to heal from post-traumatic slave syndrome.

Vision:
Through outreach and collaboration, UBLAC will help individuals foster understanding about liberation through knowledge and application in order to generate independent living and thinking.

Core Values:
Black Community, Sustainability, Inclusion, Justice, Dedication, Accountability, Integrity, Collaboration, Self Empowerment, Love Education, Trust.
