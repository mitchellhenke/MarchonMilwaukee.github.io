As part of the Milwaukee Turners' curated Mass Incarceration series, Daniel Karpowitz of the Bard Prison Initiative appears at Boswell to talk about his book College in Prison: Reading in the Age of Mass Incarceration.

College in Prison chronicles how, since 2001, Bard College has provided high-quality liberal arts education - with courses ranging from anthropology to Mandarin to advanced mathematics - to New York State prisoners who, upon release, have gone on to rewarding careers and elite graduate and professional programs. 

Drawing upon fifteen years of experience as a director of and teacher within the Bard Prison Initiative, Daniel Karpowitz tells the story of BPI's development from a small pilot project to a nationwide network. At the same time, he recounts the educational histories of individual students, tracking both their intellectual progress and the many obstacles they must face. 

Daniel Karpowitz is the director of policy and academics for the Bard Prison Initiative and lecturer in law and the humanities at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. He also the cofounder of the Consortium for the Liberal Arts in Prison, an organization that launches and cultivates college-in-prison programs across the country.
