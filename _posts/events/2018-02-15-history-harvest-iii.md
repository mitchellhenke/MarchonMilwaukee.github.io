The Milwaukee we need is built on experience — on your experiences.

The history of the Civil Rights Movement cannot be defined by a single narrative; it’s the collective story of people confronting change within their communities of faith, educational institutions and neighborhoods. The March On Milwaukee 50th Oral History Committee invites you to record your story at one of our Listening Posts and share how the 1967 Open Housing Marches impacted your life.

Buslines 30 and 14 drop off in front of Raynor Memorial Library at 1355 W. Wisconsin Ave. Metered 2 hour street parking and $10 campus visitor parking is also available.
