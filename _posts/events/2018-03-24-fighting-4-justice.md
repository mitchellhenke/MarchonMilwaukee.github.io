Interested in social justice? Come see how young people are creating change in Milwaukee! Join us for live performances, hear from local youth activists, and connect with organizations that are making a difference in our city.

This program is in collaboration with TRUE Skool and is co-sponsored by the Haggerty Museum of Art and the Center for Urban Research, Teaching and Outreach. It is presented in conjunction with the Haggerty’s "Resistance, Protest, Resilience" exhibition.

TRUE Skool’s mission is to use the urban arts as a tool to engage youth in social justice and humanities education, and community service and civic engagement.

The Haggerty Museum of Art advances Marquette University’s mission by enriching the intellectual and creative lives of students and communities at large through engagement with the museum’s collections, exhibitions, and programs.
