Please join us for the Welfare Warriors monthly meetings where we discuss our ongoing campaigns. 

This meeting will primarily be about 1) Distributing our international Mothers Activist newsjournal, the Mother Warriors Voice that is put together by low-income mamas at the Mothers Organizing Center here in Milwaukee 2) our ongoing campaign to help mothers who have had their kids removed wrongfully by child welfare with no proof of abuse or neglect and 3) our campaign to get Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to give up their child welfare contract.

The Welfare Warriors are poor mothers and others who have joined together to make our voices heard in all policies affecting families in poverty. We work on a variety of issues but our primary focus is supporting poor and homeless moms who have been wrongfully denied public benefits or moms who have had their kids removed by CPS with no proof of abuse or neglect.
