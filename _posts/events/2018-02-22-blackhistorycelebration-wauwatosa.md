At the Wauwatosa Black History Month celebration on Wednesday, February 22, 2018 at 7 p.m., students and adults will speak, sing, share poetry and honor the achievements of African Americans â€“ as well as meeting their neighbors, sharing refreshments, and making connections that will help Wauwatosa be a more welcoming community for all of its residents, students, workers and visitors. Our keynote speaker this year is Dr. Monique Liston, YWCA 2018 Eliminating Racism Award winner, and Wauwatosa Schools District Teacher-Leader.
