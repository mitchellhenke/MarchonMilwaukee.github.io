"If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything." - Malcolm X 

In honor of 200 Days of Freedom and youth activists of the past and present, Sociocultural Programming and community storyteller Adam Carr present "Resist!" Let's get off campus to explore the city while learning about events that made the history books (and the ones that didn't). We'll meet local organizers, artists, activists, and others leading the change in Milwaukee, as well as make a plan for what we can do on our own campus community! 

RSVP by checking out our website or Facebook for more information. Check-in begins at 10am in the Union Concourse. Tour departs at 10:30am sharp. Free lunch is included!
