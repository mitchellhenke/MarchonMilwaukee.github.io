A talk by Reggie Jackson on the origins of racial segregation in the Milwaukee area and an exploration of ways our suburban areas can be more welcoming to racial diversity. Reggie is the winner of several awards for his work as a speaker and consultant focusing on the African- American experience, anti-bias education programs and diversity training. The talk will be followed by a Q & A session. 
Free, everyone is welcome. 

Please come and show your support for making our suburbs more welcoming to racial diversity!
