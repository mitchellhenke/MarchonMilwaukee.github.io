Daphne E. Barbee-Wooten, daughter of late Wisconsin civil rights lawyer Lloyd A. Barbee, will share her father's stories from his fights for fair housing, civil rights and equality, drawing from her newly published Wisconsin Historical Society Press book, Justice for All: Selected Writings of Lloyd A. Barbee. A book signing will follow.

An attorney most remembered for the landmark case that desegregated Milwaukee Public Schools in 1972, Barbee frequently signed his correspondence with "Justice for All," a phrase that embodied his life's work of fighting for equality and fairness.  As the only African American in the Wisconsin legislature from 1965 to 1977, Barbee advocated for fair housing, criminal justice reform, equal employment opportunities, women's rights, and access to quality education for all, as well as being an early advocate for gay rights and abortion access.This collection features Barbee's writings from the front lines of the civil rights movement, along with his reflections from later in life on the challenges of legislating as a minority, the logistics of coalition building, and the value of moving the needle on issues that would outlast him.
