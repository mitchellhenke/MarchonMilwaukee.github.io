Join us for this important discussion of housing in Milwaukee. The presentation is part of "200 Nights of Freedom," a series of events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Milwaukee civil rights marches for school desegregation and fair housing. 

The program is co-sponsored by UW-Milwaukee Black Culture Center and The Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council. 

A panel of speakers will discuss the history of housing in Milwaukee, how it was affected by policy and race relations, and what is needed for true fair housing. 

Panelists include:

Raphael F. Ramos, J.D., Eviction Defense Project Coordinator, Legal Action of Wisconsin, Inc.
Robert S. Smith, Professor, History Department, Marquette University/Director, Center for Urban Research Teaching & Outreach
Kori Schneider Peragine, Senior Administrator, Inclusive Communities Program, Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council
