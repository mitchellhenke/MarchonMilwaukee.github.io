Intern Minister Kimberlee Carlson, responding to the call of Black Lives of Unitarian Universalism (BLUU) will preach on the topic, “The Courage to Change,” offering insights on how we individually and collectively confront issues of change in our lives, so we can challenge oppression now and for the long haul. She draws upon the work of Dr. Bobbi Harro’s Cycle of Liberation.

The Revs. Joyce Palmer and Suzelle Lynch will aid in the service, which follows on our 200 Nights of Freedom event “Open Housing: The Suburban Challenge” from September 20th, and the first White Supremacy Teach In on May 7th event at the church, responding to the call of Black Lives of Unitarian Universalism to address the ways in which white supremacy is reinforced within our faith community.
