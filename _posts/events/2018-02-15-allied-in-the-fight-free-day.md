Did you know on the Third Thursday of each month, Jewish Museum Milwaukee is open late? That’s right – we stay open until 7:00 pm so you have extra time to explore our exhibits! Not only is it ‘Thirdsday,’ but it is also a Community Free Day! Community Free Days are designed for Milwaukee County residents to explore the Jewish Museum Milwaukee for FREE!

A screening of Vel Phillips: Dream Big Dreams will be shown starting at 5:30 pm. Discover how Vel Phillips achieved an impressive list of “firsts” as part of her legacy, including the first African American judge in Wisconsin and the first woman, and African American, in the nation elected to executive office in state government. Created by Wisconsin Public Television, The Ideas Network.

Community Free Days are sponsored by Brewers Community Foundation. Offered in connection with Allied in the Fight: Jews, Blacks and the Struggle for Civil Rights, an exhibit on display at the Jewish Museum Milwaukee, January 19 – March 25, 2018."	Jewish Museum Milwaukee is dedicated to preserving and presenting the history of the Jewish people in southeastern Wisconsin and celebrating the continuum of Jewish heritage and culture. The history of American Jews is rooted in thousands of years of searching for freedom and equality. We are committed to sharing this story and the life lessons it brings with it, so that we may enhance the public’s awareness and appreciation of Jewish life and culture
