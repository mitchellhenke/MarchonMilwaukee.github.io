Each year, Skylight Music Theatre partners with Milwaukee High School of the Arts freshman to create a performance piece around a theme or topic. This year, the group will focus on the 50th Anniversary of the Housing Marches. They will write and perform a variety-style performance about how these marches affect them as youth in Milwaukee today.

This event showcases young people harnessing their power as artists and change-makers. Milwaukee Public School students bring a vibrant and meaningful potential to our city. We hope to celebrate these individuals and  consider how their understanding of the marches from 50 years ago affects their community today.
