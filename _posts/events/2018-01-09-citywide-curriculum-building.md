How do we infuse justice in everything we do?
Let's take our social justice teaching the next step forward. This session will include interactive curricular ideas, courtesy of 200 Nights of Freedom, designed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Milwaukee Fair Housing Marches of 1967-1968. We will also provide plenty of collaborative workshop time to develop your own justice-minded activities in order to evaluate the Milwaukee we've created and envision the Milwaukee we need.
