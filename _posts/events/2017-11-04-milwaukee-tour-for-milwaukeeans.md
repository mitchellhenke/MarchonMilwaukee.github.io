While Milwaukee is often called a “City of Neighborhoods,” learning about communities outside of your own can be a challenge — it’s not always obvious where to start. Join Milwaukee enthusiast Adam Carr for an in-depth bus tour and exploration of culture/history/depth/texture in Milwaukee neighborhoods.

This is the final of the two March On Milwaukee 50th tours, whose route and itinerary are inspired by Milwaukee’s Open Housing Marches in 1967/68. This will include historic locations and insight from elders who participated in the marches in the NAACP Youth Council and Commandos. Additionally, we will learn about organizing and activism taking place in Milwaukee today.

The tour will include several stops, as well as food/snacks along the route. Be prepared to get off the bus and explore. The group will meet at Haymarket Square Park on the corner of McKinley and Old World Third, we will leave right at 10am so please arrive a little early to register - free street parking is available in the area.

The tour will include a 6 stops, as well as food/snacks along the route. Be prepared to get off the bus and explore.
