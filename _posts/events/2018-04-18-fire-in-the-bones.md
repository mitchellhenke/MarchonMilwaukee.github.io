Metcalfe Lecture by Albert Raboteau, Princeton University
“A Fire in the Bones.”  Raboteau, who attended Marquette in the late 1960s, will talk about his personal journey studying and writing about African American history. Raboteau is Henry W. Putnam Professor of Religion Emeritus at Princeton University, where he spent most of his career.  

He is the author of a number of books, including Slave Religion: The “Invisible Institution” in the Antebellum South (1978), Canaan Land: A Religious History of African Americans (2001), and A Sorrowful Joy: A Spiritual Journey of an African American Man in Late Twentieth Century America (2002). He has received honorary doctorates from four universities and held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Guggenheim Foundation.
