MU Protests: Fifty Years Later
This panel discussion, moderated by Albert Raboteau and fellow MU alum Art Heitzer, Greg Stanford, and at least one other person, will reflect on the ways in which Marquette students engaged the protests of the late 1960s.

It will also mark the official launch of the Protest@MU: Dissent on the Marquette Campus website (https://protestatmu.wordpress.com).Â
