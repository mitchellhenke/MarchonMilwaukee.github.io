This is the second of  two March On Milwaukee 50th tours, whose route and itinerary are inspired by Milwaukeeâ€™s Open Housing Marches in 1967/68. This will include historic locations and insight from elders who participated in the marches in the NAACP Youth Council and Commandos.

The group will meet at Haymarket Square Park on the corner of McKinley and Old World Third, we will leave right at 10am so please arrive a little early to register - free street parking is available in the area.
