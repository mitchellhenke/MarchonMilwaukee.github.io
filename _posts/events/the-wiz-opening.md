This winter, First Stage is presenting a production The Wiz. It’s the timeless classic you know and love, with a modern, soulful twist. When an epic tornado lands Dorothy in a faraway place, she is sent on an unforgettable adventure to defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, and find the great and powerful Wiz to help her return home. Come along on a spectacular journey as Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tinman, and the Cowardly Lion ease on down the yellow brick road to the magical land of Oz.

From director and Milwaukee-based dramaturge Sheri Williams Pannell:

"THE WIZ is one of those “once upon a time” stories that starts in one place and takes us to a magical, fanciful place. It’s a fairytale with magical creatures and a young girl as the heroine. As she takes her journey to Oz, she recognizes that there are so many moments where she really is the strong one. She has the power. And it’s not in the shoes that she wears, but it really has been inside her all along. It’s a part of her journey to discover this power as she makes her way back home through all of those stops along the way with her friends – the Tin Man, who teaches her about love; the Lion, who shows her courage; the Scarecrow, who uses wisdom and knowledge. Dorothy herself has all of those qualities in her. She is strong, and yet in her vulnerable moments, because she has chosen her friends wisely, she is able to take the journey with companions who care about her and who wisely, at the end, allow her to continue and make her way back home."
