A knot of problems has persisted in the Milwaukee community for generations. What can be done about it?

From housing to education to jobs and more, the Journal Sentinel is examining complex issues confronting our community to shed light on potential solutions – so that we aren’t still struggling to answer the same questions 50 years from now.

Religious leaders were at the forefront of the civil rights movement in Milwaukee and across the nation. What is the role of the faith community today in advancing social justice?

Doors open at 6 p.m. Panel Discussion, 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Event Location: Messmer-Saint Rose
514 N. 31st St. Milwaukee, WI 53208
