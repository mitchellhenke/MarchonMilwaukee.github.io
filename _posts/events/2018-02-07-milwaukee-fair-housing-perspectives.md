February is Black History Month and the Whitefish Bay Public Library, along with One Circle Forward, are hosting two speakers to commemorate this observance. On February 7 at 6:30pm, as part of our monthly speaker series Whitefish Bay TALKS, weâ€™ll have Dr. Margaret Rozga and Fred Reed, participants of the Milwaukee Fair Housing Marches of 1967-1968.
