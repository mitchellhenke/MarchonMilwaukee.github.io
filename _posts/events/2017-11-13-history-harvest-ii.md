## The Milwaukee we need is built on experience.

Stop by our booth at the ACLU Youth Social Justice Forum to record your experiences with civil rights activism in Milwaukee past and present at one of our Listening Posts and contribute to a future where Black History isn't anonymous.

This is a 200 Nights of Freedom event hosted by the March On Milwaukee 50th Oral History Committee.
