With challenges to civil liberties, healthcare, immigration, racial justice, women's rights, and our LGBT community, this past year has been a time of struggle and change. Join us for an evening brought to you by the Shorewood Solidarity Network of personal stories of hope from members of our Greater Milwaukee Community.	

The Shorewood Solidarity Network is a community organization working to transform the Village of Shorewood, WI, through pro-immigrant legislation, protecting and making visible the rights of queer and trans*people, ending racially discriminatory police behavior in the village and in our schools, supporting worker's rights, public education, and fostering a vision of economic development that meets social needs and respects environmental and labor conditions.	

Of our 7 storytellers, 4 will share stories that involve their work for racial justice. All will tell stories that relate the intersectional oppressions they are overcoming daily.
