Prof. Kim is an internationally recognized expert on Korea and inter-Korean developments and serves on the steering committee of the international peace organization Women Cross DMZ. At UWM, she directs the Public History Program and has taught courses on modern Korea and the global history of the Korean War. An alumna of Princeton and UC-Berkeley, she recently published a timely book, Memory, Reconciliation, and Reunions in South Korea: Crossing the Divide (2017), about meetings between family members separated by the Korean divide and the role of public memory in the Korean peace process. 
The teach-in panel will also include Rev. PyungAhn “Pastor Peace” Kim, Associate Pastor at Whitefish Bay United Methodist Church; Jim Carpenter and Pam Richard of Peace Action Wisconsin; and others.
